The Free Zones are included as part of Chile?s economic territory. This means that customs declarations, which are compiled according to the Special Trade System, are adjusted, so that goods are registered as imports when they enter the Free Zones. Re-exports from the Free Zones are recorded as exports. Excluded items in trade: (According to BPM5, goods in direct transit are excluded. ) Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB). Customs value of some big-scale exports is adjusted to better reflect market prices. Estimates of prices are made to adjust preliminary customs export data on goods sold on consignment or by other mechanisms according to which definite values are unknown at the time of shipment.

By the former Central Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Croatia (CroStat), now the Croatian Bureau of Statistics (CBS, www.dzs.hr). Latest actual data: 2022 Notes: The authorities produce data from 1995 only; Earlier data result from splicing. Base year: 2005 Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data). Export and import price indices were calculated as unit value indices, in other words, indices of the change of the export and import value per quantity unit of exported/imported goods, that is, per kilogram as a uniform and comparable quantity unit for all goods. Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Export and import price indices were calculated according to the Fisher's, so-called ideal, formula, which is a geometrical mean between the Laspeyres' and Paasche's formulae. Chain-weighted: No. Export and import price indices are calculated as monthly or quarterly as compared to the base year (previous year). For example, export and import price indices for the first quarter of 2011 are calculated as compared to the period from January to December 2010. Trade System: Special trade. Special - special trade in a wider sense: processing in customs warehouses and free zones are included. Excluded items in trade: In transit; Low valued; Re-exports; Re-imports;.
